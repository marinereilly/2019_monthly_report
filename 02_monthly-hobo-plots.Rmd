##Activity Summary
####January
* Salinity Surveys
* Download Weir Hobo Data
* New Hobos were deployed at the YSI stations for Salinity, Depth and Temperature
     +Hobos deployed at Mid Station on 1/18/2019
     +Hobos deployed at South and North Stations 1/28/2019
* Work on annual report

####February (expected)
* Salinity Surveys
* Maintain Hobo sensors and download Hobo data for 4 stations

##Items of Note/Concern:
* The temperature and salinity logger at the South station has been lost.  Next time we are out we will bring the backup sensor to deploy and attempt to retrive it.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
